The game is two-person game called "Guess the Number". 

The first player thinks of an integer within a known range. The second player tries to guess the number. 

If the guess is incorrect, then the first player tells the second player whether the guess was too high or too low. 

Eventually, the second player guesses the correct number. 

The second player's score equals the number of guesses he made. 

The players then reverse their roles and repeat the game. 

The winner is the player who gets the correct answer with the fewest guesses.
