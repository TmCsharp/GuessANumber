# GuessANumber
## The next update will be contain:
<br />
<br />
· logic for difficulty, so the player can have only a few tries to guess the number.

· automatically restart the game after it is finished (or ask the player to play again).

· Can add levels so every time when the player guesses the number, the range between the minimum and maximum number gets bigger e. g. Level 1 (1 - 100), Level 2 (1-200) etc.

· Can add anything else to code, based on own ideas.
